# Introduction

The **LCC Fusion Project** brings together NMRAâ€™s **Layout Command Control (LCC)** standard and ESP32 technology, creating a flexible and scalable approach to model railroad automation. Designed for enthusiasts seeking modular and customizable solutions, LCC Fusion supports a range of automated functions, including signaling, turnout control, and power management.

Dive into the project's [documentation](https://patfleming.github.io/LccFusionProject/) to get started with setup, configuration, and application examples.
