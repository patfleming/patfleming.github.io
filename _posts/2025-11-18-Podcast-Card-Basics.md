In this LCC Fusion podcast episode, we introduce the core hardware building blocks:
the **Node Card**, **BOD Card**, **Turnout Card**, and **PWM Card**.  
We also look at how these fit the needs of **planners**, **builders**, **installers**, and **configurators**.

## What this episode covers

Join Nelson and Harrison as they explore:

### 🔧 **Key Topics Covered**

- What a **Fusion Card** is and why each one has a single, focused purpose
- The role of the **Node Card** as the “local brain” of each layout area
- Why Fusion uses the **ESP32** (kan bus support, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, low cost)
- How the **BOD** and **BSD** Cards detect occupancy and manage shorts
- How the **Turnout Card** supports many switch machine types using breakout boards
- How the **PWM Card** enables smooth lighting and motion
- The power of **LCC events** and how they eliminate long wiring runs
- Why a simple button press can throw a turnout—without any direct wiring
- Best practices when starting your Fusion layout
- How Fusion grows one card at a time

### 🧩 **What Makes LCC Fusion Different?**

Fusion builds on the LCC architecture, adding:

- More supported devices
- Easier installation
- Built-in self-testing
- Plug-and-play card detection
- Modular hardware (cards + breakout boards)

### 📺 **Future Episodes**

Stay tuned!
 We’ll dive into each Fusion Card and each Breakout Board in detail, including Turnout, Detection, PWM, Button, Audio, and more.
